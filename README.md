## Challenges 
### Asking the right questions and not trying to ask too many
The real challenge is reigning yourself in and not going off on tangets.
As I worked through the project it became increasing difficult to focus on
the initial questions asked and not to over complicate the process with the
unending questions that would appear in my head.
### Cleaning the data
This to becomes easy to overcomplicate by making sure you don't go Cleaning
data you don't need, at least within the confines of this project
### QA Process
I don't think I fully understand or can conceptualize the QA process as well
as the other steps, more practice definetely needed
